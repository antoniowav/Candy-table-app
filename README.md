# Zimpler Frontend

This is a frontend application for the Zimpler code challenge.

The application is a React application that displays a list of items in a table. The user can sort the items by clicking on the column headers. The user can also switch between a table view and a grid view.

The application also displays a loading animation while the data is being fetched.

The application is built using Create React App and is deployed on Netlify.

The data is fetched via a [Golang project](https://github.com/antoniowav/go-backend-test).

Built by Antonio Piattelli.
